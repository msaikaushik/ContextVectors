if context vectors help in authorship verification

first for training, use 

create a global corpus with all words even from the smaller corpus
use this vocabulary (collection of tokens in context vectors generation)

get context vectors for both the corpus
calculate similarity matrix - tokens x tokens
then from this matrix get observations




after = {"1" : {"1" : [], "2": [], "-1" : [], "-2":[]}}
